    'I was always passionate about computers and electronic devices since I was 7, always wondering how these things inside the screen move and how to make them yourself.-My coding journey began in 2017 in high school, where I learned some algorithms. After high school, I joined 1337 coding school in 2021, where I learned the basics of programming. I spent 2 years building awesome projects with C and C++ like Minishell, Webserv, Cub3D, and more. I got into web development last year when I built my first web project with NextJs and NestJs. I had lots of fun building it with my team. That was the last project in the common core before going out on an internship.-During my internship, I developed my skills in web development, learned a lot of new technologies, and got introduced to mobile development using Flutter. It was a great experience learning and working with the team, and I am looking forward to learning more and building more awesome projects.',
